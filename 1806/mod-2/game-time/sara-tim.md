# Game Time
* Students: Sara & Tim
* Evaluator: Brittany

Comments:
* Some opportunities for refactoring and improving naming conventions for methods/variables
* Demonstrated solid understanding of OOP classes and where behavior/values belong

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

* Gh-pages deploy

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

* Good job testing the frog over the weekend, testing overall still needs a bit more work and focus but you will have more opportunities to do that throughout the inning

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

* Nice refactoring from if/elses to switches and clean index.js file, doing no more than it needs to

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

* Commit messages need to be formatted in a clean, consistent manner. Write your message to follow [these](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) rules

* Lots of commits with commented out code and console.logs, you can use `git stash` to temporarily remove changes that you don't want to commit
