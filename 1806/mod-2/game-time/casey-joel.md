# Game Time
* Students: Casey & Joel
* Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Comments:
* UI is clean and color scheme works fine. Redundant instructions for Player 1 and 2 - look at combining these. Not clear what the numbers mean on the bottom of the screen next to `Player 1` and `Player 2`. Also - look into adding directions for user when a player collides into the wall or the other person.
* Collision works against other player and the walls - however; able to collide into self without starting game over

### Functional Expectations

* 2.5 Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

### User Interface

* 2.75 The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

- ESLint shows 2 errors - good job
- Nice job updating tests

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 2 - The developer/team makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. The team does not utilize a planning tool or equitable pairing practices. One or both members do not contribute meaningfully to the application.

- Low number of commits for this project - should be 2 to 3 times the amount when commits are atomic. Be sure to commit early and often.
- Be sure that you are following conventions for commit messages - capitalize first letter, no puncutation. A fair number of commits could use better descriptions either in the header or the body.
- Would like to see `issues` being tracked on GitHub (or some other planning tool like Waffle)
- Nice job with revisiting DTR throughout pairing.
