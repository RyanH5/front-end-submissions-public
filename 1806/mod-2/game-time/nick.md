# Game Time
* Students: Nick DAmbrosio
* Evaluator: Brittany

Comments:
* UI wasn't your best work, lots of little things here and there that could've easily been fixed up. I'd return to these issues before putting the project on your portfolio
* Testing is still slim, but going in the right direction with what to actually test
* Solid demonstration of OOP skills and where behaviors/properties belong

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

* GH-pages deploy


### User Interface

* 2.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* You'll want to test this out on multiple screen sizes, on smaller screens the instructions completely take over the UI to the point where you can't click on anything to begin the game

* Play Again text isn't super clear that I'm supposed to click on it in order to actually play it again

* When you click on 'How to Play' you should make sure the game is paused, otherwise the trails crash into eachother and the instructions get replaced by the Play Again text

### Testing


* 2.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. Some functionality is missing tests, or tests are asserting the wrong things.

* Testing is still pretty weak; make that a focus for your upcoming projects. Assertions aren't quite verifying what they should be and functionality isn't completely covered by tests

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

* Commit messages need to be styled more consistently, avoid messages like [this](https://github.com/30ozSteak/Tron/commit/ada7a1b8015ab2d3eb44c7d2bb4d3ae75cb84896) which is overly-specific screamin
