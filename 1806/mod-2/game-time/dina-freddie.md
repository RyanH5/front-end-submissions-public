# Game Time
* Students: Dina & Freddie
* Evaluator: Brittany


Comments:
* Several opportunities for refactoring, but both partners seemed aware of how to approach the improvements
* Demonstrated solid understanding of OOP and inheritance, though that block class really needs to be a player ;)
* Both built character through their struggles working through bugs and problems together

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* Take up more real estate with the actual playing field, it's a little small right now

* Change the font to something a bit more readable

* Add a 'lives' keyword to the numbers below each player so that I know what they represent

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.


### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

* Some areas for improvement on naming conventions and refactoring to DRY up the code

* Methods and instance properties are, for the most part, in the right places

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

* Some instances of commented out code
