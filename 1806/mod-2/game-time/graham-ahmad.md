# Game Time
* Students: Graham & Ahmad
* Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Comments:
* Really _LOVE_ the controllers for the user underneath the main screen. Creative yet functional and easy to understand.
* Be sure to test your screens against standard laptop sizes. When I play this game on my laptop I have to zoom out to 80% to see everything on the page.

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 2.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. ESLint shows 5+ complaints.

- Be sure to remove commented out tests from testing suite. There are a lot of formatting syntax issues in your testing suite that make some of the tests hard to read - missing semicolons, indentation, etc. 
- ESLint files shows 44 problems.


### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

- Would like to see more commits for a project of this size. Would expect to see well over 100.
- Some commit messages are a bit vague and could use some more description in the header or body of the commit (e.g., `Fix buggy code`, `Clean up codebase`, etc.)
