# Game Time
* Students: Alex R & Ashton
* Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Comments:
* Easy to follow directions - clean UI. Possibly add notification that game is speeding up each time snake has eaten 5 blocks of food. Game is really slow to start - possible for first level to be a bit faster? Maybe new iterations/levels could involve speeding up snake but also adding obstacles?
* Nice job articulating your code and speaking to inheritance. 

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested. ESLint shows 5+ complaints.

- Shows ESLint errors concerning line length - 7 total errors;
- Needs more testing: Should be testing default properties on classes, when classes are updated, as well as methods on class (missing from both `Block` and `Game` testing)

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

- Good amount of commits for project size
- Nice use of issues for tracking - be sure to add more for those things that you are still looking to refactor
