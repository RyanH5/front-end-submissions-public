# Game Time
* Students: Ben & Tobin
* Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Comments:
* Good, clean UI to start. Some directions would be nice for people have not played Frogger before (i.e. The goal is to make it to the other side ive times, into one of the alcoves... That the second portion you should be jumping onto the moving blocks and avoiding the "water", etc.)

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 2.75 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

- ESLint shows 3 errors
- You can remove the tests for DOM interactions

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

- Good amount of commits
- Majority of commits following conventions around good commit messages and do a good job describing what is included in the particular commit. Be sure to take advantage of using the `body` of a commit message for additional info about a commit
- Would like to see more issues - both `open` and `resolved`
