### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### README Updates
- Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### Workflow

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.
