# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of

[happy code](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js)

- I was happy about building a server with KNEX for the first time.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about

[sad code](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

- I would like to pull out some of the functions into separate smaller single responsibility functions. But overall I
  really enjoyed the DOM traversal practice.
