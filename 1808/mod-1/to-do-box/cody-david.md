## Students: Cody Price & David Cisneros
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Getting better at creating more commits (continue to break it into even more)
  * Commit messages could be a bit longer and more descriptive
  * Branches could also be more descriptive
* Good work with the comp and UI
  * Upvote, downvote, quality, and complete task get a bit squished on mobile
  * Might make the completed task text on the button a bit bigger on desktop view
* Clean html structure and good names for classes
  * Remember to add aria-labels and roles next time for accessibility
* Remember to keep text-align only on text elements
  * Remember to group elements that have similar styles and if there are multiple classes that share styles, start a new class and put it on those
* Nice work with no nested if/else statements and global variables
* Good use of constructor function
  * Try combining the two card adding functions into one
* Try using array prototype methods over for loops
* Experiment using function declarations instead of anonymous functions in event listeners
* Might use an array for qualities instead of multiple if/else statements
* Instead of storing each todo individually, try storing them under one key and all the todos in an array
