## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work with descriptive commits and branches
  * Make sure both of ya'll are getting reps and commits in
* Good work with UI and UX
  * I love the required field that pops up if the user tries to click on the save button
  * Might make some of the text a bit bigger on complete todo button
  * In mobile view, could make the quality sort buttons a bit bigger and stack them on top of each other
* Nice work adding aria labels to inputs and forms
  * Only have one h1 and if you need to style part of the title, use a span
  * Might add a role to the div with your filtering options
  * Might remove the brs since that is only for styling purposes and css would be a better case to style it correctly
* Nice work alphabetizing the properties
  * Stay away from using percentages on font sizes (use pixels or percentages)
  * Also refrain from using text-align on articles or sections and keep it only on text elements
  * Shouldn't need position relative on the card-container
  * Remember refactoring can include html and css, not just js (if you can defend your argument on why something should be changed, then change it)
* Cheers to no global variables and no anonymous functions in event listeners.  HOORAY!
* Nice use of constructor function
  * Might be careful with what you are keeping track of in constructor function if it is not dynamic
* Try using event delegation with event listeners instead of inline functions on appended cards
* Experiment storing your todos in an array in local storage rather than as individual items
* Also experiment using array prototypes over for loops
* For your filter functions for each quality, instead of having multiple functions that are all similar, try passing the qualityIndex as an argument into one function
* Instead of hiding elements on the dom, since it still remains in the DOM tree, trying removing the elemtns as you search through the 2dos
