## Students: Theo and Kylie
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- nice UI, on mobile filter buttons should be same width as cards and inputs for consistency
- HTML could use a little bit of a polish pass
- JS has opportunities for additional refactor and DRY-ing up of code
- good shared ownership of codebase, you are both able to speak to what it's doing and the thought process that went into it
