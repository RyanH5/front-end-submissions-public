## Students: Mike and Lindsey
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- inline editing
- UI looks nice, thoughtful and clean attention to details
- caught that there were many unused properties in the CSS and did a good job cleaning it up!
- JS is clean, a couple spots that could be a little DRY-er (upvote/downvote) but overall it's easy to read and clear
- well done!
