HTML

JS
* Think about where you can pass arguments when there is duplication between functions
* Think more about naming conventions - ToDo or Task instead of Card for constructor - its not a card until its on the page as such
* Think about being consistent with the two pieces (1. update the data model, 2. update the dom)
