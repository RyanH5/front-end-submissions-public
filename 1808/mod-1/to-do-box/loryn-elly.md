## Students: Loryn Mason & Elly Torres
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good commit messages and improvement on making more commits
  * Continue to make more commits and branches for each feature or bug fix
  * Make more descriptive branch names
* Good UI and UX
  * Good choice in colors
  * The upvote, downvote, importance level, and complete buttons get a bit squished on mobile view
  * Might also add a hover state on the complete button
* Good clean html structure
  * Would add aria labels to forms and inputs and buttons
  * Good descriptive class names
* Good organization of styles
  * Remember to alphabetize the properties of styles
  * Don't need relative positioning if the element is only acting like a block element and we don't need to change the top/left, etc.
  * A few extra places where would could group classes that have similar styles
* Nice work with no global variables
* Make sure lines of code in if/else statements are indented correctly
* Good work with the constructor function and only keeping things you need
* Nice work using the filter array prototype
  * Be aware that hiding elements does not remove it from the DOM tree
* Try storing the 2dos in an array under one key instead of multiple keys
* Nice work using an array and iterating through importance levels based on if the user is clicking up or down
  * Might be able to combine the upVote and downVote functions into one and pass arguments you need
