## Student: Sabrin Nasreddin & Adam Niedzwiecki
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on having more commits
  * Would focus on making more detailed commit messages and more branches for each feature
* Good work matching the comp on the desktop view
  * Make sure to add the class of read on the whole idea card to match the spec
  * A few wonky things with mobile view where things don't stay centered and the cards don't get moved down
* Experiment using aria labels for inputs and buttons inside of form
* Potentially try adding a few clearer roles on sections
* Make sure everything is properly indented in the HTML (was mostly consistent)
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
* Be consistent with tabbing in properties for each class
  * Also add spacing between classes for developer empathy
  * Good use of grouping styles ( still more places where we can group similar styles or use classes in multiple places)
* Good work organizing global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
  * Be consistent with styling of javascript and tabbing correctly (take a look at the styleguide)
* Good use of event delegation
* Good work breaking out functions  into smaller functions and reusing them
* Good naming on your functions
* Some global variables, like the counters, could potentially be scoped locally (either declaring them in functions or grabbing the value from the DOM)
