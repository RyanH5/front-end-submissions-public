## Student: Eric and Hillary
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

HTML
* Consider using aria-labels on inputs that don't have labels associated with them

CSS
* Consider using multiple classes where you have a more broad class for shared styles: ie. card-button

JS
* Good naming conventions
* Try to see if a string includes something in it instead of matching the whole thing, as the whole thing will likely change
