## Student: Jake Lauer & Kylie Stanley
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* I love how many commits ya'll have.  Now work on creating more branches!  =)
* Nice work on matching the comp.  Couple things when the screen gets smaller but sounds like ya'll had that fixed on another branch.
* Maybe find a different color that goes on the outside of the app
* Stay away from nested divs (especially for the error section, might want to add a role)
* Maybe find another html element than footer 
* If it is only for styling purposes, and it isn't a link, use a button for the read and delete elements
* Good work on organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
  * Some places where we could minimize the styles and bring it back either using grouping or using a class in multiple places
  * Some places where there are some interesting uses of positioning in a hacky fix (might be a hint to find another way to control the elements)
* Nice work organizing global variables, event listeners, and function delcarations
  * Be consistent in either using named functions or anonmymous functions 
* Nice use of a while loop
* I like that you're already experimenting with ternaries and using expressions that evaluate to true or false instead of using if/else statements for the disabled
* Keep working on using less global variables
