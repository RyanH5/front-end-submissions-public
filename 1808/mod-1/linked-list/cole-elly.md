## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good start with the commits and commit messages (be consistent with clear messages)
  * Creat more branches any time you work on something (never work off of master)
* Nice user experience and UI
  * I would clear out the inputs each time you create a new bookmark
* Inputs get a bit squished at the breakpoint (either implement it sooner or use percentages on the inputs)
* Good structure of HTML and keeping it clean
* Would use sections instead of divs 
* Would experiment using aria-labels for your inputs and buttons in forms
* Instead of using a ul for your cards, try using a section and articles for each card instead of li elements
* I might add border-box to the top so nothing fishy goes on with styles
  * Good organization of styles
  * Be consistent with alphabetizing properties of styles
  * Good use of grid
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Good use of regex for validating url
* I would break out the bigger createBookmark function into a smaller ones (gets hard to read)
  * Experiment using event delegation next time instead of manually adding event listeners
  * Separate function delcarations.  Can be really confusing having function declarations inside of function declarations
    * Invoke the function and pass arguments through if you need to access values from the previous function(super important to get comfortable with this)
* Instead of alerts, incorporate the error into the DOM
