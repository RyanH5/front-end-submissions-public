## Student: Justin Torrance & Kaylee Bunce
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Need many more small commits and branches for each feature
  * Each time you are working on a bug, adding some styles, writing a new function etc.
* Great work on the comp and matching the design
* Good use of semantic tags and aria labels to describe inputs and buttons
  * A few places where we could replace divs with semnatic html
* Nice work CSS, a few situations where we could group some similar styles together
* Nice organization of of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Remember to clear out console.logs before evals
* Instead of using alerts, try implementing the errors in the DOM
* Good work breaking functions out into smaller functions 
* A few situations where you might be able to take away some of the global variables (the counters)
* One or two situations where we don't need the extra else if statement, an else statement would work fine
