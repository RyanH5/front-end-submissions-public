## Student: Mike Duke & Loryn Mason
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work on commits and branches
  * I would be a little clearer with commit messages (using imperative tense) and more detailed branches
* Good work matching the comp
  * Noticed things don't always stay centered vertically as it gets smaller (this will be easier once we go over flex)
  * On mobile view, text of cards could be a bit bigger for readability
* Really clean html structure
  * Try adding aria labels to inputs in forms
  * Totally okay to add grid to the body
* Nice work with organization of css and alphabetizing properties
  * Good work grouping css classes and finding those parts where there are repeated lines
* Be careful using vw and vh especially with responisve applications
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Awesome work starting to use constructor functions
* Nice work breaking out functions into smaller functions
* Really great refactoring and keeping things readable and clean
* Make sure to have event as parameter so nothing wierd happens
* Implement error handling in the DOM rather than using alerts
