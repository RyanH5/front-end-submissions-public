## Student: David Cisneros & Libby Yeh
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Creating more commits and branches each time you are implementing a new feature
* Being consistent in design and keeping the design flat (specifically talking about the counter)
* For mobile view, might want to make the inputs and buttons a bit smaller so it fits better for a phone
* Nice clean structure with your HTML
  * Maybe add some roles on to your sections and some aria labels to your forms, inputs, buttons, etc.
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing CSS styles
* Places where you are using positioning relative, see if you can control that without having to change the positioning (maybe flex?);
* Find places where you can use short hand for style properties (like the shortcut for margin)
* Keep working on refactoring styles
* Nice work organizing global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Good consistency with using named functions on your event listeners
* Don't really need the Array.from since document.querySelectorAll already returns you an array
* For your next project, try using event delegation instead of having to manually add event listeners
* Experiment using parentNode in order to move up the DOM tree to add that class of "read" to a bookmark
