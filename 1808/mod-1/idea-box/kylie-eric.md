## Student: Kylie Stanley & Eric Fitzsimmons
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work creating more commits and having descriptive messages
  * Continue to keep creating more branches and have specific names for each branch
* Might add more spacing between buttons
* Really good attention to detail and nice UX/UI
* Nice work with keeping a clean html structure and using aria-labels
  * Can also add aria-label to button inside of form
* Nice work with organization and alphabetizing css properties
* Good work grouping some styles and using one class for multiple items
  * Be careful using vh when looking at responsiveness.  Practice not only squishing it horizontally but also vertically
* Cheers for no global variables!
* Nice work using a constructor function for your Ideas
* Clear names for your functions
* For your refactor, see if you can store all of the ideas in localstorage with one key and a value of an array
* Careful not to use nested if/else statements
* See if you can put your qualities inside of an array and go through the qualities by index
* For your search functionality, instead of doing display none, see if you can remove the ideas (the elements are still on the DOM even if they have display none)

## Functional Expectations
