## Student: Lindsey Wilhite & Mariel Waters
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice detailed messages and branches (good story flow to each of them)
  * Continue to break into even more branches/commits
* Couple of spacing issues with the UI 
* Continue to work on disabling the submit button and how to change the quality of the targeted card
* Super clean dom structure and use of aria-labels
  * Might use a header instead of a section (for the top part)
  * Might use another section instead of a ul for the idea container
* Nice work alphabetizing the properties for styles and organzing them 
* Try keeping ems/rems for fonts and percentages/pixels for heights, widths, margins, paddings, etc.
* Places where you see repeated code in styles, try grouping them together
* Nice work with organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Experiment using a constructor function for your ideas 
* Try storing your ideas in an array in local storage
* Careful of using nested if/else statements.  It can be difficult to read and hard to scale
* Keep finding places where you can refactor.  I do like how you've broken your functions into smaller functions though.  Cheers!
