## Student: Chris and Loryn
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- no global variables!
- in a good place to refactor: watch function lengths, some places that could be a little more DRY
- use `vh` `vw` sparingly in CSS, they can have some funky side effects in your UI and cause misbehaving
- overall, well done.
