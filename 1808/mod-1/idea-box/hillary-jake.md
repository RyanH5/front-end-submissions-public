## Student: Hillary and Jake
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- can add tags
- really nicely done UI! A couple spots to polish: on the sticky header, have the product name stay visible as well as the tags, and mobile have the tags be in a menu that can be collapsed so they don't hie all your cards!
- paired together on Jake's computer, so there's a of disparity in number of lines of code committed
- one function handles upvote and downvote
- make sure you both own the full codebase -- aim for equal contributions to JS and CSS
- really, really well done!
