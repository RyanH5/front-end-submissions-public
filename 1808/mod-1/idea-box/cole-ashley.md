## Notes/What To Work On:

HTML
* Good semantic html - provide instructions instead of redundant info with aria labels

CSS
* Consider adding organizational comments
* DRY it up for maintainability (maybe a small-button class) - love the multiple class pattern

JS
* DRY it up for maintainability
* Consider using arrays and leveraging indices to display text ie. qualities
* Love that you're using debugger to traverse the dom - continue doing that!
* Consider places where you can leverage bracket notation

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
