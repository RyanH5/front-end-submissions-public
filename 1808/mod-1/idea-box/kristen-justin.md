## Student: Kristen Hallstrom & Justin Torrance
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work with the commit messages
  * Continue to keep creating more commit messages and having smaller commits for each feature
* Nice work with the comp and matching it
  * Make sure the delete button is also the svg from the comp
  * Good UX/UI and good mobile view
  * Might add a little more spacing between the top and title to match the spacing between the save button 
* Really nice with HTML structure and keeping things clean
  * Remember to add aria-labels to inputs and buttons inside of forms
* Nice work alphabetizing the properties and structuring your css
  * Might consider sticking with usings ems/rems only on fonts.  And only pixels/percentages for heights, widths, margins, and paddings
* Nice work with organizing your javascript into global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Nice use of event delegation for the delete button
* Really like the filter array prototype method 
* Seems like upvote and downvote buttons got pretty complicated and snowballed into a wierd issue 
  * So thinking how we could simplify this, I might try having the qualities inside of an array and through the the array by either incrementing or decrementing the index

## Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
