## Notes/What To Work On:
* Great comp design, a few user experiences that could be improved on
  * Make sure buttons change color when they are enabled
  * Keep experimenting with how to make the min and max numbers show up
* Great work on HTML and organization
  * Good experimentation with input range
  * Experiment adding function on input ranges using event listeners rather than adding them to the HTML
  * Use sections instead of divs
  * Instead of having multiple forms for each input, try putting multiple inputs in one form when the inputs are similar
* Good use of grouping styles
  * Try alphabetizing properties next time
  * Use text-align only on text tags (p, h1, etc.)
  * When you have multiple classes that are doing the same thing, try using only one class
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and functions
  * Good use of if/else statements to handle multiple situations
  * Remember to clean up commented out lines and console logs for evals
  * Good use of breaking out functions into smaller functions (a few places where we could do more of that)
