## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good UI and I really appreciate the attention to the User Experience
* A few things on UI that are a bit off from the comp
  * Spacing in the title
  * The width of the buttons should match the width of the input
  * Keeping the min/max inputs the same size as the guess input
* Mostly good with spacing and tabbing in HTML (a few instances where it was off)
  * No need to add extra sections if you don't need it specifically for your styling (keep HTML structure as clean as you can)
* Good organization of styles
  * Good work alphabetizing properties (be consistent)
  * Good clean CSS, a few instances where classes could be grouped 
* Good organization of Javascript dividing global variables, event listeners, and function delcarations into separate sections
  * Good use of isNan function
  * Clean up commented lines and console.logs before evals
  * Good use of breaking out functionality into smaller works (continue to do more of this)
  * Good use of reusing functions
  * Shouldn't need to querySelect again in functions (look into this more)
  * Stay away from double assigning things in the same line (example var minRange = minRange.input.value = 'Min Range')

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.
