## Notes/What To Work On:
* Great work on the user experience of your application
  * Covered all edge cases
* Some things on the UI could match a bit better with comp
  * Make sure buttons and inputs are all same size
  * Take a closer look at spacing between elements
* Good organization and structure of HTML
  * Good use of semantic tags
  * A few situations where spacing could be improved on
  * A few instances where a better HTML tag could've been used (p tag instead of span)
* Good organization of styles 
  * Make sure text-align is only on text elements, not sections
  * Experiment with shorthand for border-radius
  * Experiment with grouping classes
  * Try alphabetizing your style properties or grouping properties together by similar types
* A few instances where functions get a little long
  * Starting to get some pretty big functions 
  * Try breaking out functions into smaller functions especially when you see things being repeated often (single responsibility functions)
  * Things that are being repeated, like making buttons disabled or clearing inputs, break out into its own function
