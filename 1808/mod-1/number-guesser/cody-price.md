## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on user experience and UI
  * Maybe add a little more spacing between elements so they don't get too cramped
* Good structure and spacing of HTML
  * I would remove commented out lines in the future for evals
  * Use more semantic tags instead of html
  * Keep onclick handlers in your javascript instead of HTML
* Use more classes instead of IDs
  * Keeps IDs on forms and inputs
* Good use of grouping for styles
  * Keep text-align on text elements only, not sections or divs
  * Experiment more with using margins and paddings instead of position relative for positioning
* Pay attention to organization of properties (either alphabetically or by similar types)
* Good organization with global variables 
  * Nice use of isNan function
  * I love the statusUpdate function.  Good use of finding repeated functionality and drying it up
  * Stay away from returning multiple things in a function (many of the situations i saw you actually do not need to return something.  Assigning the innerText a value will work)
  * Keep variables in functions a little more locally scoped instead of reassigning your querySelectors (wierd things can happen when doing this)
  * Continue to find more situations where you can break out functionality (keep functions single responsibility)
