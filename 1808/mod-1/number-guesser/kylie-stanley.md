## Notes/What To Work On:

- Clean UI/UI - just be sure to replicate the comp exactly unless given creative liberty
- Nice job using semantic HTML
- Avoid in-line JS in HTML - keep HTML, CSS, JS separated
- Hooray for alphabetized declarations in CSS!!! Look into [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) for organizing styles
- Err on the side of classes before IDs - avoids IDs in CSS
- Nice job with naming in JS - easy to follow
- Love the spinning text functionality when you win!
