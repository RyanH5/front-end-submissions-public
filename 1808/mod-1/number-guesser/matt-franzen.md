## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on design and comp and I like the instructions
  * From a user experience, the clear button is a bit confusing that it clears stuff and changes the difficulty
  * Something to keep in mind is to find ways to simplify the design and UX so that the user doesn't need to read instructions
  * Try putting the change in difficulty once they win
  * Pay attention to spacing between elements
* Good organization and tabbing of HTML
  * Make sure to load script after body
  * Try using p tags instead of h5 and h6 elements when it is only a description
* Good organization of styles
  * For margins and paddings, there are a few spots that don't have the label of percentage or pixels
  * Try grouping your hover and disabled states for classes or use only one class 
* Good organization dividing global variables, event listeners, and function delcarations into separate sections
  * Clean up console.logs and commented out lines for evals
  * A few places where we could break out functions into smaller functions (keeping functions single responsibility)
