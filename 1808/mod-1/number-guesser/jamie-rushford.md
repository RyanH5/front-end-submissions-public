- Like the bouncing animation for winning!
- Be sure to add directions for the user about the range changing - the numbers positined on the side are not intuitive
- Nice job using forms around inputs
- Good organization in CSS - look into [clustering related properties](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for a different approach to organization
- Watch formatting in your JS files - follow the style guide [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
- Work on naming in JS 
- Nice job with breaking functionality apart
