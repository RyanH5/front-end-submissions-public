## Notes/What To Work On:
* Great work on design
  * Maybe add more spacing between elements
  * Make sure width of buttons and inputs are the same width
* Good structure and organization of HTML
* A few too many extra divs and sections for styling purposes
  * See if you can simplify the HTML structure
  * Try using a h1 tag instead of a p for the title part
* Good organization of styles
  * Experiment using ems or rems for text fonts
  * Good alphabetizing the properties (be consistent)
* Great organization of javascript dividing it into global variables, event listeners, and functions
* Be consistent in using anonymous or function declarations in your event listeners
* Nice work on keeping functions short and clean (DRY)
  * Add some spacing between functions and event listeners for readability (white space is okay)
