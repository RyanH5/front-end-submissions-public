## Notes/What To Work On:

* Change your tab sizes to 2 spaces instead of 4!!!!!

html 
* lose the brs
* consider looking into css bem
* think "what semantic element can I use instead of a div"

css
* alphabetize rules as you go for better scannability (never at the end because that misses the point)
* consider using bem

js
* dry it up
  * look at duplicate chunks of code and think of how you can use a function and pass in dynamic pieces
* use array prototype methods for mutating your arrays (ie. push and shift)
