## Notes/What To Work On:

- Clean UI/UI - just be sure to replicate the comp exactly unless given creative liberty
- Use `form` istead of `p` to wrap your inputs
- Nice job with organization in CSS file!
- Good naming conventions with JS file - makes code easy to follow
- Would have liked to see you reach for the extensions/choose your own adventure
