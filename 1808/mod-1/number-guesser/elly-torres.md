## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice attention to detail with your UI and UX (user experience)
  * The header title doesn't appear to be quite centered vertically
  * Otherwise very nice match to the comp and handling all edge cases
* Great work on keeping your HTML structure clean and using semantic html tags
  * Instead of using two spans in the h1, try styling the h1 one way and then add the span around the other word
  * Experiment using ids for inputs
  * Move script tag after the body element
* Nice clean CSS styles
  * Good use of grouping the styles
  * Stay away from using text-align on body, sections, divs, etc (use only on text)
  * Good use of ems on fonts
  * Focus on organization of properties for next project (alphabetically or by similar type)
* Good job separating global variables and event listeners
  * I would focus on finding instances where you are repeating lines of code and breaking them out into smaller functions (keeping functions single responsibility)
  * Good consistency of using anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Good handling of multiple scenarios
  * Found a couple situations where you were grabbing elements a 2nd time in functions when you already had them in global variables (shouldn't need to do that)
