## Project Name: Elder Flower

#### Check In:

- 2

#### Progress made?

- I have knex, express, ngrok, and twiml setup.  I am close to being able to send a message from my phone to the number, but am getting a 404 code.  My table is setup and am soon to input users.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

- Create users, and send message

#### Next Steps?

- Finally sending messages, and then able to send from the app with the input forms.

#### What are your concerns (if any)

- Still dont quite grasp the flow of twilio, express, knex, ngrok...

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- Focus on styling throughout app
  - Login flow, account creation, account page
- Continue on sending/recieving SMS
