# Project Name: Dive Line
Check In: 9/10/18

# Progress made? 

I'm able to fetch and get photos and files from specific folders in the Dropbox API and display them on the 
screen.  I set it up to display in App first and have been trying to get it converted over to work with Redux.  I set up the 
store and thunks but haven't been able to get the photos to display.

# What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?  

Need to get Redux working.  I didn't do the form completely as we talked about because I am not sure that it's going to work with what else I want to do.  Would like to discuss...

# Next Steps?  

- Getting Redux completely working and then figuring out the dive cards.

# What are your concerns (if any):  

I just need some feedback on how best to implement what I am trying to do.  I feel that I can
go a few directions with this. 

# Deliverables for next checkin: 

- Create dive log form (on frontend)
- Have app create some kind of file on form submission (could just be .txt file)
