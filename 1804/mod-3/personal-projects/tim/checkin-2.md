## Dead Drop Check In:

### Progress made?

Obtaining Authorization token and persisting in Redux store. Fetching user profile image and username. Testing actions and reducers has begun.

### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I need to look more in depth to googlemaps

### Next Steps?
More testing, propTypes, rendering dead drops board and making post.


### What are your concerns (if any)
I seem to be making more fetch calls after data is obtained from Pinterest. I need to cut this down in order to avoid getting throttled.

### Deliverables for next checkin:
• Styling
• Display images and comments
• claim deaddrop functionality
• Prop Types
• Testing
• Nice-to-have is the map functionality
