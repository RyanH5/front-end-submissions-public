## Dead Drop

#### Check In:

#### Progress made?

Receiving Oauth access code, unable to obtain Authorization token. file structure is set up along with Redux store. First action is also established along with React-Router.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

Need to make first fetch call and start initial testing.

#### Next Steps?

Obtain Authorization token so I can make fetch calls.

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Working with OAuth has been pretty challenging so far. Due to Pinterest's security concerns I also needed to access an outside utility for port forwarding. This requires its own level of maitenence.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Get access token
* Make fetch and get data in the store 
* Start testing
* Start looking into google maps
