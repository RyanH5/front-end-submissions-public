### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### SASS/SCSS

- Pass - Styles are written using either SASS or SCSS

### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 2 - Developer(s) make large, inconsistent commits that contain irrelevant changesets and make it difficult to follow the evolution of the application. Developer(s) rarely use git branches and frequently incorporate changes directly into master with little or no review process. There are instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.
