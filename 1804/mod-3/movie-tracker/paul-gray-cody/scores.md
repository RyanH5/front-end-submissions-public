* 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

* 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### SASS/SCSS

* Pass - Styles are written using either SASS or SCSS

### Testing

* 3+ - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3+: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
